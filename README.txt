This is the small version of the pack (256x256px font files) which is necessary due to a limitation that has been in Minecraft since 1.13 where it doesn't use larger font files. (See https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-133372)

For the original 512x512px big pack take a look here: https://cdn.moep.tv/files/Custom_Icons_Resource_Pack_big.zip
